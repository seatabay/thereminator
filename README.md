# Thereminator
Light and hand position controlled cheap and accessible theremin.

This project appeared in after 3 hours of brainstorming for an approaching deadline!

Accesing musical instruments are not easy for people all around the globe, therefore we aimed to utilize whatever we have and some people may have too. Initial goal of the project is to utilize objects we may have, a laptop and a smart phone to keep the gesture and interaction of playing an instrument. Theremin is one of the instruments controlled by no physical touch and the distance from two antennas. In this project, the gestures of both hands are preserved and the sound synthesis part has been done with a Pure Data patch.
